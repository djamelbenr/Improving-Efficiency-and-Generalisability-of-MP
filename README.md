![Visitors](https://api.visitorbadge.io/api/visitors?path=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdjamelbenr%2FImproving_Efficiency_and_Generalisability_of_Motion_Predictions_with_Deep_MultiAgent_Learning%2F&label=VISITORS&countColor=%23263759)

This project is focused on developing a data-driven prediction framework for highly automated vehicles (AVs), leveraging multiple inputs to provide a multimodal, probabilistic estimate of the future intentions and trajectories of surrounding vehicles in freeway operations. Our proposed framework utilises deep multi-agent learning to effectively capture social interactions between vehicles, without relying on map information. Please refer to our recent [publication](https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2023.3339640) for more details. This algorithm has demonstrated superior prediction performance, with reduced error in real-world traffic data from highways. Evaluation using the NGSIM (US-101 and I-80) and HighD datasets indicates strong prediction performance for long-term trajectory forecasting of multiple surrounding vehicles. Furthermore, the framework exhibits enhanced prediction accuracy and generalisability compared to state-of-the-art methods.

* Unzip and extract vehicle-trajectory-data into raw/us-101 and ./raw/i-80  
  
From googledrive:  
* Download i-80: https://drive.google.com/open?id=19ovxiJLCnS1ar1dYvUIrfdz_UnGejK-k  
* Download us-101: https://drive.google.com/open?id=14dMKew22_5evfOoSGEBYqHP3L92e7nyJ  

Dataset fields:  
* doc/trajectory-data-dictionary.htm  

This Dataset is to be pre-processed with the Matlab function preprocess_data.m (that is a slightly modified version of the one from https://github.com/nachiket92/conv-social-pooling)

* Already preprocessed samples: (to run tests on Hybrid-Models)
    * https://drive.google.com/open?id=171YZvK2DnJbtIgve6qAOkk6AFNrGAYTJ

Dataset fields:  
* doc/trajectory-data-dictionary.htm  

## HighD 
   * [https://www.highd.com/](https://www.highd-dataset.com/)

## Pre-processed NGSIM and HighD can be downloaded from [here](https://connectqutedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/n10439251_qut_edu_au/Documents/processed_data/OneDrive_1_4-20-2023.zip?csf=1&web=1&e=uRNYbS)

Data Preparation:
The raw data of Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) is downloadable at https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/trafficanalysistools/ngsim.htm

1. Download the data:      Once the data downloaded the raw data into ```./raw```
2. Preprocess the data : Run 
```
preprocess_data.m to pre-preprocess the raw data (note: the pre-processed data will be uploaded on cloud).
```
This repository is for testing the trained models for motion prediction on highways. No end-to-end trainer is needed here.
3.To use the pretrained models at ./ .py and evaluate the models performance run! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
```
python3 evaluate.py --name ngsim_model --batch_size 64 \
    --test_set ./datasets/NGSIM/test.mat 
```   

Trained models can be downloaded [here](https://connectqutedu-my.sharepoint.com/)
