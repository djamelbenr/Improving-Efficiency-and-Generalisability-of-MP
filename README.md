# Improving-Efficiency-and-Generalisability-of-Motion-Predictions-with-Deep-Multi-Agent-Learning-and-Multi-Head-Attention

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=djamelbenr/Motion-prediction-with-Deep-Multi-Agent-Learning-and-Multi-Head-Attention)

This work aims to design a data-driven prediction framework for highly Automated Vehicles (AVs) that utilises multiple inputs to prove a multimodal, probabilistic estimate of the future intentions and trajectories of surrounding vehicles in freeway operation. Our proposed framework is a deep multi-
agent learning-based system designed to effectively capture social interactions (please refer to our recent [paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2022.3207347) between vehicles without relying on map information. This algorithm achieved a good prediction performance with a lower prediction error in real traffic data at highways. Evaluation of the proposed framework using the NGSIM (US-101 and I-80) and HighD datasets shows satisfactory prediction performance for long- term trajectory prediction of multiple surrounding vehicles. Additionally, the proposed framework has higher prediction accuracy and generalisability than state-of-the-art approaches.

# Datasets

## NGSIM
  
From NGSIM website:  
* Register at [NGSIM](https://data.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Next-Generation-Simulation-NGSIM-Vehicle-Trajector/8ect-6jqj)  
* Download [NGSIM-US-101-LosAngeles-CA]US-101-LosAngeles-CA.zip and [NGSIM-I-80-Emeryville-CA] I-80-Emeryville-CA.zip  
* Unzip and extract vehicle-trajectory-data into raw/us-101 and ./raw/i-80  
  
From googledrive:  
* Download i-80: https://drive.google.com/open?id=19ovxiJLCnS1ar1dYvUIrfdz_UnGejK-k  
* Download us-101: https://drive.google.com/open?id=14dMKew22_5evfOoSGEBYqHP3L92e7nyJ  

Dataset fields:  
* doc/trajectory-data-dictionary.htm  

This Dataset is to be pre-processed with the Matlab function preprocess_data.m (that is a slightly modified version of the one from https://github.com/nachiket92/conv-social-pooling)

* Already preprocessed samples: (to run tests on Hybrid-Models)
    * https://drive.google.com/open?id=171YZvK2DnJbtIgve6qAOkk6AFNrGAYTJ

* doc/trajectory-data-dictionary.htm  

## HighD 
   * [https://www.highd.com/](https://www.highd-dataset.com/)

## Pre-processed NGSIM and HighD can be downloaded from [here](https://connectqutedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/n10439251_qut_edu_au/Documents/processed_data/OneDrive_1_4-20-2023.zip?csf=1&web=1&e=uRNYbS)
## Argoverse

Get the data from the Argoverse website:
* https://www.argoverse.org/

Put their API from Argoverse in a directory at same depth named "Argoverse"
* https://github.com/argoai/argoverse-api

# Special instructions for Hybrid Models: 
Setup the name of the trained model in the load_name field of config file (.yaml) (follow the example: <model>_<dataset>_<id>)
Run python ```test_models/save_trained_model.py``` to save the prediction results computed on the test set (after training).
Run python ```test_models/statistic_result.py``` to print metrics evaluation (RMSE,NLL, etc.), plot covariance matching and error histogram (from the saved results).




Data Preparation:
The raw data of Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) is downloadable at https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/trafficanalysistools/ngsim.htm

1. Download the data:      Once the data downloaded the raw data into ```./raw```
2. Preprocess the data : Run 
```
preprocess_data.m to pre-preprocess the raw data (note: the pre-processed data will be uploaded on cloud).
```
This repository is for testing the trained models for motion prediction on highways. No end-to-end trainer is needed here.
3.To use the pretrained models at ./ .py and evaluate the models performance run! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
```
python3 evaluate.py --name ngsim_model --batch_size 64 \
    --test_set ./datasets/NGSIM/test.mat 
```
