# Improving_Efficiency_and_Generalisability_of_Motion_Predictions_with_Deep_MultiAgent_Learning
The proposed algorithm is a deep Multi-Agent learning-based system leverages RNNs and Transformers to design spatial-temporal interactions among vehicules without relying on map informations. Training and Testing are performed in the NGSIM (US-101 and I-80) and HighD datasets.
